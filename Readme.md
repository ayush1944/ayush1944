I build and ship production-grade web products with real users, real deployments, and real constraints.  
My focus is clean frontend architecture, reliable backends, and owning features end-to-end.

## About Me

I’m a full-stack developer working primarily with **React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB**.  
I’ve shipped complete systems — authentication, admin dashboards, analytics, AI integrations, email notifications, and real-time features.

I’m comfortable debugging production issues, managing environment variables, setting up CI/CD, and improving systems after launch. I value clarity, maintainability, and predictable behavior in production.
